# FSJS Project Eight

This is the eight project of the www.teamtreehouse.com Full Stack JavaScript techdegree utilizing SQLite3 with Express.js and Node.js through a popular ORM(Sequelize). The project uses a pre-included mockup of a library database that executes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations and can add, remove, or edit books inside the database. In this project, I learned the basic concepts of using an ORM to interact with a SQL database and perform simple operations that will later be built on top of by using more advanced procedures as the course progresses.
